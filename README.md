# Flatmemory

Flatmemory is a C++20 library for serialization and zero-cost deserialization. Serialization is the problem of creating sequential representation of an object, and zero-cost deserialization is the problem of accessing the data without creating the original object. Flatmemory uses the typical approach by employing builders for serialization and views for deserialization, offering significant performance advantages over traditional compiler-generated memory layouts.

## Key Features and Advantages

1. **Efficient Memory Management:** Flatmemory excels in scenarios where minimal memory allocations are critical. Builders reuse their memory, and serialized data can be efficiently written to large preallocated buffers. This minimizes the overhead typically associated with object creation and memory management.
2. **Cache-Friendly Data Layout:** The library stores data contiguously in memory, enhancing cache locality. This leads to improved runtime performance, especially in scenarios where large datasets are processed.
3. **Composite and Trivial Types:** Flatmemory supports a variety of composite types like `Tuple`, `Vector`, and `Bitset`, as well as nested types. Trivial types `T` that satisfy `std::is_trivially_copyable_v<T>` are stored in place, while non-trivial types are managed using offsets. This balance ensures flexibility while maintaining performance.
4. **No Code Generation Required:** Unlike some serialization libraries, Flatmemory does not rely on code generation tools, simplifying the build process and reducing dependencies.
4. **Optimized for Immutable Data:** Flatmemory is particularly well-suited for scenarios involving the creation of many immutable objects. While mutability is allowed, structural changes to serialized objects (like inserting elements into a vector) are restricted to prevent overwriting adjacent data.

## Limitations

1. **Fixed Memory Layouts:** Once an object is serialized, its memory layout cannot be extended while maintaining backward compatibility. This trade-off is necessary to achieve the libraryâ€™s performance goals.
2. **Non-Resizable Objects:** Serialized objects have a fixed size, and operations that would alter their structure (such as inserting elements in a vector) are not permitted.

## Example

In this example, we use a `Builder` to serialize a 2-dimensional `Vector` of `uint16_t` into a sequence of bytes. A respective `View` can interpret the data.

```cpp
#include <flatmemory/flatmemory.hpp>

// 1. Type def the Dispatcher.
using TwoDimVecUint16 = Vector<Vector<uint16_t>>;

// 2. Print the static Layout
Layout<TwoDimVecUint16>().print()

// 3. Construct a Builder, feed it with data, and finish the byte sequence.
auto builder = Builder<TwoDimVecUint16>();
builder.resize(2);
builder[0].push_back(5);
builder[1].push_back(6);
builder[1].push_back(7);
builder.finish();
EXPECT_EQ(builder.get_size(), 36);

// 4. Construct a mutable View to interpret and modify (with limitations) the byte sequence.
auto view = View<TwoDimVecUint16>(builder.get_data());
EXPECT_EQ(view.buffer_size(), 36);
EXPECT_EQ(view.size(), 2);
EXPECT_EQ(view[0][0], 5);
EXPECT_EQ(view[1][0], 6);
EXPECT_EQ(view[1][1], 7);

// 5. Construct a immutable ConstView to interpret the byte sequence.
auto const_view = ConstView<TwoDimVecUint16>(builder.get_data());
EXPECT_EQ(const_view.buffer_size(), 36);
EXPECT_EQ(const_view.size(), 2);
EXPECT_EQ(const_view[0][0], 5);
EXPECT_EQ(const_view[1][0], 6);
EXPECT_EQ(const_view[1][1], 7);

// 6. Insert a buffer into a set either using Builder, View, or ConstView
auto unordered_set = UnorderedSet<TwoDimVecUint16>();
auto const_view1 = unordered_set.insert(builder);
auto const_view2 = unordered_set.insert(view);
auto const_view3 = unordered_set.insert(const_view);
EXPECT_EQ(const_view1, const_view2);
EXPECT_EQ(const_view2, const_view3);
```


## Getting Started

We recommend the following sequence of cmake commands to install the headers. No build step required.

```console
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_DIR="path/to/install/dir"
cmake --install build
```

We recommend adding the following to your root `CMakeLists.txt` for making the headers available for your CMake project where `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` is the installation directory

```cmake
find_package(flatmemory REQUIRED PATHS ${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH} NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
target_link_libraries(<your_target> flatmemory::flatmemory)
```


## For Developers

We provide a CMake Superbuild project that takes care of downloading, building, and installing all dependencies.

```console
# Configure dependencies
cmake -S dependencies -B dependencies/build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=dependencies/installs
# Build and install dependencies
cmake --build dependencies/build -j16
```

Flatmemory's testing framework depends on [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and requires the additional compile flag `-DBUILD_TESTS=ON` to be set in the cmake configure step.

Flatmemory's performance framework depends on [GoogleBenchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) and requires the additional compile flag `-DBUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON` to be set in the cmake configure step.
